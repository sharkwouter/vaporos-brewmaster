{"name":"Vaporos Brewmaster","tagline":"Brewmaster release of VaporOS","body":"# VaporOS Brewmaster\r\n\r\n VaporOS - a version of the Stephenson's Rocket SteamOS installer with multiple added packages.\r\n \r\n# Improvements\r\n\r\nVaporOS adds the following packages to Stephenson's rocket:\r\n\r\nBPM\r\n- Kodi, a media player which offers a great experience on a TV with a controller (you can add it as a library shortcut from the setting)\r\n\r\nDesktop\r\n- VLC, a media player\r\n- Gedit, a text editor\r\n- File Roller, an archiving tool\r\n- Gnome Tweak Tool, which allows you to configure the desktop in many additional ways\r\n\r\nCommand line\r\n- bash-completion, for making it easier to use the commandline\r\n\r\nFor a more detailed list of added package, take a look at the file changes.txt.\r\n\r\n# Planned improvements\r\n\r\n- Bringing back the controller binds from old versions of VaporOS.\r\n- Automatic updates for packages specific to VaporOS. Currently security updates for the additional packages will have to be installed manually from the Debian repositories!\r\n\r\n# How to install?\r\n\r\nISO's for the latest releases are always available on http://trashcan-gaming.nl/\r\n\r\nOtherwise you could build it yourself.\r\n\r\n## Installing from a DVD\r\n\r\nJust burn the ISO to a blank DVD from your favourite tool, and boot it.\r\n\r\n## Installing from USB (Mac)\r\n\r\nOpen a Terminal window from the Utilities section of Applications.\r\n\r\nType `diskutil list` to get a list of devices - one of them will be your USB stick (e.g. `/dev/disk2`). Follow the Linux instructions below, with this `/dev/rdiskX` entry instead of `/dev/sdX`\r\n\r\n## Installing from USB (Linux)\r\n\r\nPlug in the USB stick and run `dmesg`; look for a line similar to this:\r\n\r\n    [377039.485179] sd 7:0:0:0: [sdc] Attached SCSI removable disk\r\n\r\nIn this case, `sdc` is the device name for the USB stick you just inserted. Now we put the installer on the stick, as root (e.g. use `sudo`) run \r\n\r\n    dd bs=1M if=/path/to/vaporosX.iso of=/dev/sdX \r\n    \r\nsdX should be the USB stick device from the information you received from `dmesg`. Be sure to use sdX, not sdX1 or sdX2. Then boot into the stick.\r\n\r\n## Installing from USB (Windows)\r\n\r\nDownload [Win32 Disk Imager](http://sourceforge.net/projects/win32diskimager/) and use it to copy the .iso to your USB stick (1GB minimum size).\r\n\r\n## Once the installer is up...\r\n\r\nPick the \"Automatic Install\" option to wipe the first hard disk in your system and install SteamOS to it.\r\n\r\nFor more sophisticated booting - e.g. dual-boot or custom partition sizes - select the \"Expert\" option. Use of this mode is documented in the support video [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3MjkfMs-4T4).\r\n\r\nBeyond that, just follow Valve's instructions from [their site](http://store.steampowered.com/steamos/buildyourown) - Stephenson's Rocket should behave exactly like the real SteamOS, except it works on more systems\r\n\r\n# How to build an iso?\r\nTo build the iso you'll need to use a Debian based distribution like Ubuntu, Mint or Debian itself.\r\n\r\nSince VaporOS is based on Stephenson's Rocket, you'll have to clone that repo before building the iso. You can do that with the following command:\r\n\r\n    git clone --depth=1 https://github.com/steamos-community/stephensons-rocket.git\r\n\r\nAfter you've done that move into the newly created repo and clone this repo like this:\r\n\r\n    cd stephensons-rocket\r\n    git clone --depth=1 https://github.com/sharkwouter/vaporos-brewmaster.git\r\n    \r\nNow you can build the iso with:\r\n\r\n    ./gen.sh -n \"VaporOS Brewmaster\" vaporos-brewmaster\r\n    \r\nYou will be missing some dependencies, but the script should tell you how to get them. The resulting iso will be called vaporos-brewmaster.iso.\r\n\r\n# Known issues and workarounds\r\n\r\n- Running in Virtualbox is not supported.\r\n\r\n# Special Thanks\r\n\r\n- All contributors to Stephenson's Rocket, Directhex in particular.\r\n- [40-1]PvtBalderick, for help with ideas and testing.\r\n- ProfessorKaos64, for help with ideas and testing.\r\n- Dubigrasu, for help with development, testing and ideas.\r\n- Nate Wardawg, for the name.\r\n- Jorgën Såagrid, for allowing the continued use of the name VaporOS.\r\n- Valve for creating SteamOS in the first place.","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
